                                        I came across a video on YouTube showing the way upper class ladies were
                                        dressed in the eighteenth century. I had seen more dresses like that and I was
                                        planning on going to a fantasy festival. That is what made me decide to try and
                                        make an own interpretation of this. This is the first time I attempted to make an
                                        accurate historical costume.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I started out by buying fabrics. I was lucky to get a linen that I could use which was
                                        wider than normal. Normally fabrics are about 150cm wide, this one was in the
                                        curtain section and 220cm wide. That gave me a lot more material at once. I decided
                                        to start off with the shift. This I drafted from a shirt of my own. I had the shift widen
                                        out at the bottom. The sleeves I made with a simple sleeve pattern cut on fold. It was
                                        a simple piece to make but still looks relatively good. The second thing I made was
                                        the first underskirt. This I made by pleading the fabric to my waist measurement and
                                        attaching in to a waistband. The skirt is knee length and closes with a button. After
                                        that I made the bum pad and the pockets. The bum pad was just a roll tapered at the
                                        ends and filled with stuffing. The pockets are two rectangles that I closed in the
                                        middle of the front. I left an opening so I could put stuff in it. Both are tied to a string
                                        of fabric and are tied to the waist separately. Over top of this all is a floor length
                                        underskirt which I made the same way I did the first underskirt. This one is closed
                                        with a tie and has holes at the sides so I can reach into the pockets. All these pieces
                                        are made from that one piece of linen that I found.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        The final skirt I made from a light, off white cotton with a small print on it. The
                                        waistband of it is made from an off white cotton. It is a gathered skirt made from two
                                        rectangles. The top of the sides is open so I can reach into the pockets underneath.
                                        The skirt ties at the sides in little bows with straps coming from the waistband.
                                        I made the stomacher from the same fabric as I made the waistband of the final skirt.
                                        The decoration on it are made from the fabric of the skirt. I’ve gathered them into
                                        flowers and they are stitched on with a bead in the middle.
                                        The dress is made from a light blue cotton. I’ve made it in two steps. First I made the
                                        top part of it using a top of mine as a guide for the pattern. I’ve decorated the top with
                                        a fringe of the same fabric and a lace ribbon on top of that. The sleeves of the top are
                                        decorated with a lace trim as well. I’ve used a different piece of lace for this and used
                                        three layers of the lace to create the look I wanted. The skirt is pleaded to fit my waist
                                        and later attached to the top. The ribbon from the top goes all the way to the bottom
                                        of the skirt to create more of a one-piece look.
                                        The model in the pictures is a friend of mine. The corset is not completely accurate
                                        but I haven’t been able to find or make a stays yet. The hat is bought for this
                                        costume.

                                        I was inspired by a puzzle my dad was making. It was a puzzle with a
                                        nineteenth century American setting with a woman who was wearing a very
                                        pretty outfit. I decide to do some research about it so I can recreate the outfit
                                        as a costume.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        The main thing I wanted to find out was which layers go underneath and how wide
                                        the crinoline is supposed to be. I found out the whole outfit has about four to five
                                        layers. I’ve drawn them all out to make sure I knew what the layers consisted off. I
                                        have one layer complete already since I can use that from an earlier project and it
                                        involves the corset. The other layers I need to make myself. These are the shift, split
                                        drawers, crinoline cage, underskirt, corset cover, final skirt and final blouse. I am very
                                        excited about this project since I really want to make something Victorian. This is a
                                        little bit different from the original British dresses from that era which makes it even
                                        more interesting.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h1>Crinoline</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        I decide to start off with the crinoline, since I really wanted to try to work with
                                        metal boning. I had never done this before, but working with reed made me
                                        more enthusiastic and confident with it. So I bought some boning and other
                                        materials from the internet and started.
                                        My first attempt went quite well. I started with making the waistband and attaching
                                        the vertical supports of twill tape. After that I made the horizontal boning channels by
                                        sewing on twill tape and folding them in half. I sewed across the top to close them off,
                                        leaving one end open to insert the boning. With this attempt I made a big mistake.
                                        The crinoline turned out nice but was way too small. I had envisioned it a lot larger.
                                        So I tried again.
                                        The second time I made wider hoops and also more hoops. Instead of four hoops, I
                                        added six to make the shape more fluent. The waistband I made from the twill tape
                                        now as well since I thought this was a lot easier. I also sewed the ends of the boning
                                        channels together to close the circle before folding the twill tape in half to create the
                                        channels. I left a gap to insert the boning which I closed later by hand. The second
                                        try went much better and I am much happier with the result. The crinoline is now the
                                        size I want it to be and much smoother as well.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <h1>First layer</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        The first layer of the undergarments consists of the chemise and the split
                                        drawers. These garments protect the clothing from body oils and are worn for
                                        modesty. These are light weight garments which are washed often.
                                        I made the chemise and split drawers from a fabric that I found at the thrift store. I
                                        like this fabric very much because of the pattern and the embroidered bow on the
                                        bottom of it. At first I was afraid the fabric wasn’t big enough to make both the
                                        chemise and split drawers from it. Fortunately, I had enough fabric to make both of
                                        the pieces out of it. I tried to make my own pattern from scratch without draping the
                                        fabric but this didn’t work out well. I changed plan and started using patterns that I
                                        found in pattern magazines. I did alter these patterns slightly to make them closer to
                                        the design. The fabric that I’m using is very thin. That made me decide to use a
                                        second layer to make it a little more appropriate.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I have designed the chemise and drawers with a lace trim. I’m going to crochet this
                                        lace myself.
                                        The fabrics I’m using are both made of cotton.
