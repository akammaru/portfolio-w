            Martin Garrix is an inspiration to me ever since I found out about him. This is mainly because of the fact that we were born in the same year. I believe if he can become a DJ at age seventeen I can become whatever I like as well at any age.

        <p>I always believe in the positive side of things. I only give up when I feel like I’ve done everything I could. I prefer to think in solutions rather than thinking in problems. For the past three years sewing has become a part of my live.
            My mother taught me the basics of sewing and I still ask her if I have a problem. I also learnt a lot from the internet, mainly from YouTube. I wanted to learn to sew because I want to be able to make my own clothes. I don’t want to depend on what is in stores or what is made by others. I also experience hard times finding pieces that speak to me. By making my own I can express myself better.</p>

        <p>I prefer to make historical costumes since I am more interested in that. My imagination is big and fashion cannot describe what is worn in the stories in my head. With the costumes I get much closer. I also have more interest in past fashion and I like to think about what is worn in the future. This isn’t as big as the historical part but is definitely growing. I’ve been making costumes ever since I was eight, but rediscovered it when I was eighteen. I’ve been making costumes ever since.</p>

        <p>A lot of my inspiration in live comes from Martijn Garritsen or Martin Garrix. I think it’s very special what he does and he makes me believe I can achieve my dreams too. Another inspiring person to me is the YouTuber Angela Clayton. She recreates historical fashion and I learned a lot from watching her videos. Some movies also inspired me a lot. These are ‘the Chronicles of Narnia’ and ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’. I really love the costumes in those movies and of course the movies in general as well.
            However, it was the series ‘Once upon a Time’ and ‘Game of Thrones’ that made me realize there is a possibility of turning my love into a full-time job. Michele Clapton and Eduardo Castro are big inspirations for me. The make me see I could get very far with what I love.</p>
